#        The intelligence database is for surveillance feeds from the physical world,
#        including various SIGINT sources such as WIFI SSIDs, BSSIDs, bluetooth devices,
#        cellular IMSI and TMSI data, and so on.  If it can be discovered, this database
#        should be extensible enough to collect it for analysis.
