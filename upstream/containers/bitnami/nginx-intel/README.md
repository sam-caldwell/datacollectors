## Why use Intel optimized containers

Encryption is becoming pervasive with most organizations increasingly adopting encryption for application execution, data in flight, and data storage. Intel(R) 3rd gen Xeon(R) Scalable Processor (Ice Lake) cores and architecture, offers several new instructions for encryption acceleration. These new instructions, coupled with algorithmic and software innovations, deliver breakthrough performance for the industry's most widely deployed cryptographic ciphers.

This solution accelerates the processing of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) significantly by using built-in Intel crypto acceleration included in the latest Intel 3rd gen Xeon Scalable Processor (Ice Lake). For more information, refer to [Intelâ€™s documentation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/wordpress-tuning-guide-on-xeon-systems.html).

It requires a 3rd gen Xeon Scalable Processor (Ice Lake) to get a breakthrough performance improvement.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## How to deploy NGINX Open Source for Intel in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami NGINX Open Source for Intel Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/nginx-intel).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami NGINX Open Source for Intel Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/nginx-intel).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the
[list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/nginx-intel/tags/)
in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/nginx-intel:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
$ cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
$ docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Hosting a static website

This NGINX Open Source for Intel image exposes a volume at `/app`. Content mounted here is served by the default catch-all server block.

```console
$ docker run -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/nginx-intel/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:


```yaml
services:
  nginx:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/app:/app
  ...
```

## Accessing your server from the host

To access your web server from your host machine you can ask Docker to map a random port on your host to ports `8080` and `8443` exposed in the container.

```console
$ docker run --name nginx -P bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

Run `docker port` to determine the random ports Docker assigned.

```console
$ docker port nginx
8080/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32769
```

You can also manually specify the ports you want forwarded from your host to the container.

```console
$ docker run -p 9000:8080 bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

Access your web server in the browser by navigating to `http://localhost:9000`.

## Configuration

### Adding custom server blocks

The default `nginx.conf` includes server blocks placed in `/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/`. You can mount a `my_server_block.conf` file containing your custom server block at this location.

For example, in order add a server block for `www.example.com`:

## Step 1: Write your `my_server_block.conf` file with the following content.

```nginx
server {
  listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
  server_name www.example.com;
  root /app;
  index index.htm index.html;
}
```

## Step 2: Mount the configuration as a volume.

```console
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro \
  bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/nginx-intel/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro
  ...
```

### Using custom SSL certificates

*NOTE:* The steps below assume that you are using a custom domain name and that you have already configured the custom domain name to point to your server.

#### Step 1: Prepare your certificate files

In your local computer, create a folder called `certs` and put your certificates files. Make sure you rename both files to `server.crt` and `server.key` respectively:

```console
$ mkdir -p /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs
$ cp /path/to/certfile.crt /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs/server.crt
$ cp /path/to/keyfile.key  /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs/server.key
```

#### Step 2: Provide a custom Server Block for SSL connections

Write your `my_server_block.conf` file with the SSL configuration and the relative path to the certificates:

```nginx
  server {
    listen       8443 ssl;

    ssl_certificate      bitnami/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key  bitnami/certs/server.key;

    ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  5m;

    ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

    location / {
      root   html;
      index  index.html index.htm;
    }
  }
```

#### Step 3: Run the NGINX Open Source for Intel image and open the SSL port

Run the NGINX Open Source for Intel image, mounting the certificates directory from your host.

```console
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro \
  -v /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs:/certs \
  bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/nginx-intel/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
  ...
    volumes:
    - /path/to/nginx-persistence/certs:/certs
    - /path/to/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro
  ...
```

### Full configuration

The image looks for configurations in `/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf`. You can overwrite the `nginx.conf` file using your own custom configuration file.


```console
$ docker run --name nginx \
  -v /path/to/your_nginx.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf:ro \
  bitnami/nginx-intel:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/nginx-intel/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your_nginx.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf:ro
  ...
```

## Reverse proxy to other containers

NGINX can be used to reverse proxy to other containers using Docker's linking system. This is particularly useful if you want to serve dynamic content through an NGINX frontend. To do so, [add a server block](#adding-custom-server-blocks) like the following in the `/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/server_blocks/` folder:

```nginx
server {
    listen 0.0.0.0:8080;
    server_name yourapp.com;
    access_log /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/logs/yourapp_access.log;
    error_log /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/logs/yourapp_error.log;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;

        proxy_pass http://[your_container_alias]:[your_container_port];
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

## Logging

The Bitnami NGINX Open Source for Intel Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs nginx
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose logs nginx
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Customize this image

The Bitnami NGINX Open Source for Intel Docker image is designed to be extended so it can be used as the base image for your custom web applications.

### Extend this image

Before extending this image, please note there are certain configuration settings you can modify using the original image:

- Settings that can be adapted using environment variables. For instance, you can change the port used by NGINX for HTTP setting the environment variable `NGINX_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER`.
- [Adding custom server blocks](#adding-custom-server-blocks).
- [Replacing the 'nginx.conf' file](#full-configuration).
- [Using custom SSL certificates](#using-custom-ssl-certificates).

If your desired customizations cannot be covered using the methods mentioned above, extend the image. To do so, create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/nginx-intel
### Put your customizations below
...
```

Here is an example of extending the image with the following modifications:

- Install the `vim` editor
- Modify the NGINX configuration file
- Modify the ports used by NGINX
- Change the user that runs the container

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/nginx-intel

### Change user to perform privileged actions
USER 0
### Install 'vim'
RUN install_packages vim
### Revert to the original non-root user
USER 1001

### Modify 'worker_connections' on NGINX config file to '512'
RUN sed -i -r "s#(\s+worker_connections\s+)[0-9]+;#\1512;#" /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf

### Modify the ports used by NGINX by default
ENV NGINX_HTTP_PORT_NUMBER=8181 # It is also possible to change this environment variable at runtime
EXPOSE 8181 8143

### Modify the default container user
USER 1002
```

Based on the extended image, you can use a Docker Compose file like the one below to add other features:

- Add a custom server block
- Add custom certificates
- Clone your web application and serve it through NGINX

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  nginx:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '80:8181'
      - '443:8443'
    depends_on:
      - cloner
    volumes:
      - ./config/my_server_block.conf:/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/conf.d/server_blocks/my_server_block.conf:ro
      - ./certs:/certs
      - data:/app
  cloner:
    image: 'bitnami/git:latest'
    command:
      - clone
      - https://github.com/cloudacademy/static-website-example
      - /app
    volumes:
      - data:/app
volumes:
  data:
    driver: local
```

#### Adding custom NGINX modules

To add a custom NGINX module, it is necessary to compile NGINX with that module and copy over the appropriate files to the Bitnami image.

##### Example

Below is an example Dockerfile to build and install the NGINX Perl module (`ngx_http_perl_module`) over to the Bitnami image:

```Dockerfile
ARG NGINX_VERSION=1.22.0
ARG BITNAMI_NGINX_REVISION=r0
ARG BITNAMI_NGINX_TAG=${NGINX_VERSION}-debian-11-${BITNAMI_NGINX_REVISION}

FROM bitnami/nginx-intel:${BITNAMI_NGINX_TAG} AS builder
USER root
## Redeclare NGINX_VERSION so it can be used as a parameter inside this build stage
ARG NGINX_VERSION
## Install required packages and build dependencies
RUN install_packages dirmngr gpg gpg-agent curl build-essential libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libperl-dev
## Add trusted NGINX PGP key for tarball integrity verification
RUN gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 520A9993A1C052F8
## Download NGINX, verify integrity and extract
RUN cd /tmp && \
    curl -O https://github.com/intel/asynch_mode_nginx/download/nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    curl -O https://github.com/intel/asynch_mode_nginx/download/nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz.asc && \
    gpg --verify nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz.asc nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    tar xzf nginx-${NGINX_VERSION}.tar.gz
## Compile NGINX with desired module
RUN cd /tmp/nginx-${NGINX_VERSION} && \
    rm -rf /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel && \
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/bitnami/nginx-intel --with-compat --with-http_perl_module=dynamic && \
    make && \
    make install

FROM bitnami/nginx-intel:${BITNAMI_NGINX_TAG}
USER root
## Install ngx_http_perl_module system package dependencies
RUN install_packages libperl-dev
## Install ngx_http_perl_module files
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl
COPY --from=builder /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/modules/ngx_http_perl_module.so /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/modules/ngx_http_perl_module.so
## Enable module
RUN echo "load_module modules/ngx_http_perl_module.so;" | cat - /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf > /tmp/nginx.conf && \
    cp /tmp/nginx.conf /opt/bitnami/nginx-intel/conf/nginx.conf
## Set the container to be run as a non-root user by default
USER 1001
```
